"""Select the dated sections a gather-learnings run reads, across one vault folder.

The `notes-*` logs are dated H2 sections, newest first: `## YYYY-MM-DD` with an
optional suffix (`## 2026-08-20-AB-AND-C`). File mtime cannot drive selection --
one edit restamps the whole file -- so the heading date is the only honest signal.
A heading is recognized by its date prefix alone, so `## 2026-08-20 - a title` is
listed too, flagged as non-canonical because section keys need the `-SUFFIX` form.

The default run is the daily one. Today's date comes from the clock unless pinned
with `--today`. Every `notes-*` file with a section dated today contributes those
sections, plus its most recent earlier date as the baseline they are checked
against. Files with nothing dated today are not in the run. The learnings file's
own entry for today, if one exists, is reported first, with every entry on its most
recent earlier date as the baseline today's entry is compared against once written.

`--days`, `--since`, `--calendar` and `--today-only` select the older lookback
windows instead.

`user-stories*.md` carry no dates at all. They are read by lookup instead: the
story ids named inside the selected sections are the keys, printed here so the
caller reads only those sections rather than a 272KB file.

stdlib only, one consumer (the gather-learnings skill).
