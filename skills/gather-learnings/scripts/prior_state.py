"""The last known state of what today's notes and today's learnings entry name, from the
knowledge graph.

Two reads, both through `markdown-kg`'s own CLI and its JSON output:

  work items  Every work-item id named in today's `notes-*` sections is a registered graph
              entity, so `timeline` returns every section that mentions it, in any note, by
              date. The latest mention before today in each note is the state today's claim
              is checked against, whichever file it sits in.

  learnings   Each `###` subsection of today's learnings entry is matched against the older
              learnings subsections that share its identifiers: work items through `timeline`,
              backticked identifiers and `ABC-123` codes through an exact-phrase FTS `query`.
              Each hit is a supersession candidate to read, never a verdict. The authored
              notes that name the same identifiers are listed too, as correction targets.

Exact identifiers only. A claim phrased two ways with no shared identifier is not found
here, and the walk still has to catch it. The graph must already hold the older entries.
Today's notes and today's entry are read from the vault folder itself, so the graph can
be the vault's own or one ingested from a copy of it elsewhere (`--graph`).
